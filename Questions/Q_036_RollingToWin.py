Suppose you are playing a game with a fair die (e.g. no bias for any one side), and 
your expected payout based on the # you roll is shown the table below. 
If you have to pay $1 to play, is it worth the cost to play?

Roll	Payout
6	    $4
5   	$2
4	    $1
3   	$0
2	    $0
1	    $0
"""

"""
No Bias in the dice
So, Expected value of the game = (1/6)*4 + (1/6)*2 + (1/6)*1 + (1/6)*0 + (1/6)*0 + (1/6)*0 = 1.167
Since we spend $1 for playing, Expected value = 1.167 - 1 = 0.167 

As the average return > 0, it is worth the cost to play.
