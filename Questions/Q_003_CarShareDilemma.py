Question 3 - The carshare dilemma
We have selected a group of people to take a survey. 
35% of the group like Uber, 20% like both Lyft and Uber, and 25% like neither Lyft nor Uber.

Given this information, what percentage of the sample likes Lyft?
"""

"""
P(Uber) = 0.35
P(Lyft) = ?
P(Uber and Lyft) = 0.2
P(Neither Uber nor Lyft) = 0.25

0.35 + x - 0.2 + 0.25 = 1
0.4 + x = 1
x = 0.6

So 60% like Lyft
