"""""""""
Given a matrix with m x n dimensions, print its elements in spiral form.

For example:

#Given:
a = [ [10, 2, 11],
[1, 3, 4],
[8, 7, 9] ]

#Your function should return:
10, 2, 11, 4, 9, 7, 8, 1, 3
"""


def print_spiral(nums):
    # 10, 2, 11, 4, 9, 7, 8, 1, 3
    # 4 Indicators -- row start and end, column start and end

    return


a = [[10, 2, 11],
     [1, 3, 4],
     [8, 7, 9]]

print_spiral(a)
