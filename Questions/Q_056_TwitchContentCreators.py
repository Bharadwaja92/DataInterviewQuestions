Suppose you are working for a company like Twitch.tv. Twitch.tv is a live streaming platform, 
where content creators (e.g. the people creating content on the live streams) can receive donations 
from viewers for producing content they support.

Your company is trying to launch a new product that will benefit content creators who get a large 
amount of donations per streaming session.

Can you write a SQL query to find the top 10 content creators in 2018 that have had the highest 
average donations per viewer?

You are given the following tables:

Table: all_donations
