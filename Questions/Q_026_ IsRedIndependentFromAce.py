Is drawing a red card and drawing an ace independent? 
Hint: Drawing an ace (event A) and drawing a red card (event B) are two separate events -- 
think of a way to prove (using probability theory) that knowing whether event A occurred impacts the 
probability of event B occuring.

"""
P(Red) = 26/52 = 1/2  (Hearts and Diamonds)
P(Ace) = 4/52 = 1/13

P(Red Ace) = 2/52 = 1/26

For 2 events to be independent, their product of probs must be equal to joint probability
So, we need to check if         P(Red Ace) = P(Red) * P(Ace)

P(Red) * P(Ace) = 1/2 * 1/13 = 1/26 = P(Red Ace)

So, they are independent
